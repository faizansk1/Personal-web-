Build a GPA calculator website for students that is fast, mobile-friendly, and easy to use. The site should allow users to calculate semester and cumulative GPA by entering their grades.

The website must be SEO-optimized to attract organic traffic and designed for Google AdSense compliance, including essential pages: Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, About, and a simple contact form (no personal info required).

Additional requirements:

Clean, modern, student-focused design

Accurate, instant GPA calculations

Educational content or guides to help students understand GPA


The goal is to create a trusted academic tool that provides value to students while generating traffic and AdSense revenue.Lovable AI websites aren’t worth it for long-term growth. It’s better to create the website using WordPress or a similar scalable platform since WordPress is great for SEO and helps generate organic traffic over time.
